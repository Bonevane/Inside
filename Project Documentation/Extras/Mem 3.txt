Standing at the precipice of our dreams...
The moonlight bathed the scene in a melancholic glow as we confronted the harsh reality of this world...

ADRIAN:
Nell, I know this is hard. But I think it's important that we keep the house.

NELL: 
We need to talk about this. You must realize by now that selling the house is the only way!

ADRIAN: (stubborn) 
Nell, we can't do that. This place is your dream. I can't take that away from you.

NELL: (frustrated) 
I know that! But dreams can't save you...We're running out of time.

ADRIAN:
There has to be another way, Nell. 
Trust me. We'll find a way out of this...

NELL:
We've searched enough already...
There's no other way. I can't watch you suffer anymore.

ADRIAN:
So what? you're just going to erase everything we've built?
Everything we've been through?

NELL:
I don't want to erase anything, Adrian.
But we can't live in this fairy tale while reality crumbles around us!

ADRIAN: 
But this place meant everything to you!

NELL: 
I know!
I know...
But we have to make sacrifices to survive, Adrian. Why can't you see that?

The tension escalated. The cliffside that we once adored, turned into a silhouette of its former self.

ADRIAN:
You're willing to throw away our dreams for practicality? For money?

NELL:
I'm willing to do whatever it takes to save you! 
But you're so blinded by this place that you can't even see the truth.

ADRIAN: 
If that's how it is...then maybe I should just leave. 
Maybe then you can sell the damn house and save yourself from the burden of taking care of me.

NELL: 
Oh yeah. Maybe you should! 
Maybe this house is better off without someone who's so unwilling to fight for their own life.

I saw him leave. I held the power to stop him. Yet, I couldn't.
I stood there alone, amidst the empty cliffside.
Surrounded by the shattered remnants of a dream that once held so much promise.
