The evening sun melted into the sea, casts a golden farewell. 
We sit on a blanket spread over the grassy knoll, the remnants of our wedding celebration echoing far in the distance.

NELL:
Can you believe it's finally done?

ADRIAN:
Feels surreal.
In a good way, though.

We clink our glasses together, toasting to our newly cemented union...

NELL:
Remember when we used to come here just to escape?

ADRIAN:
Yeah, our little sanctuary. We've come a long way since then.

You know...I never thought I'd find someone like you.

NELL:
I hope that's a good thing.

ADRIAN:
Oh it's the best.

I see his eyes light up with a glint of enthusiasm.

ADRIAN:
I was thinking...

NELL:
Hmm?

ADRIAN:
What if we built something here? Something...to remember.

NELL:
A sanctuary for ourselves?

ADRIAN:
Exactly! Our home, on the edge of everything. 

Our little piece of eternity.


I let out a small chuckle

NELL:
Haha...I knew it.

ADRIAN:
No good?

NELL:
Oh no. I love it.
Our own haven.

ADRIAN:
Exactly my thoughts...

NELL:
Hey.

ADRIAN:
Yeah?

NELL:
You think we'll ever get tired of this view?

ADRIAN:
Never. It's like our personal masterpiece.

NELL:
But life's going to change now, isn't it?

ADRIAN:
I suppose so...in the best possible way.

We clasp our hands, a silent promise for the adventures ahead.

ADRIAN:
To us, and a lifetime of these moments.

NELL:
To us...
